# faceMaskDetection

Here is the Convolutional Neural Network to detecting masks on faces of people in front of the camera or in the video. 

- faceMaskDetection.ipynb file is colab notebook, which shows creating of the neural network including analysis of input data.
- cameraStreamAnalyzer.py file is python file, which detects faces from the camera stream using the opencv library, and then determines whether the image shows a masked person.
